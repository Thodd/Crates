Crates
======

A small Flashpunk puzzle-game, based on the classic `Block Dude`. Actually it's just a remake, same levels, but new graphics and style.

### Game Credits
`Block Dude` is a classic TI-83+ game developed by www.detachedsolutions.com.

Thanks Brandon Sterner, you saved my a lot of boring school lessons.
And I believe this game (and the TI-83+) is part of the reason why I graduated in Computer Science...
so thanks for that ;)
