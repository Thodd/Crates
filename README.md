A small Flashpunk puzzle-game, based on the classic "Block Dude".

Actually it's just a remake, same levels, but new graphics and style.

### Credits
"Block Dude" is a classic TI-83+ game developed by www.detachedsolutions.com.
Thanks Brandon Sterner, you saved my a lot of boring school lessons.
And I believe this game (and the TI-83+) is part of the reason why I graduated in Computer Science...
so thanks for that ;)
